> Reduced test case for committing dist with semantic-release

Want semantic-release to commit a build? Here's one approach:

1. Initialise semantic-release with your repo as normal
2. Generate a new GitHub access token (only repo/public_repo scope is required)
3. Run `travis env set CI_USER_TOKEN [token]`
4. Add a npm build script that's suitable for your project
5. Copy [scripts/deploy.sh][] into your project and fill out your details
6. Add this to as a npm deploy script
7. Add a predeploy script that runs the npm build script
8. Call `npm run deploy` after `semantic-release pre`

That's it!

Pro tip: create a machine/bot account on GitHub (generate a access token for
this account) and add it as a collaborator (with push access) to your repo.

Pro tip: add `scripts/deploy.sh` to your `.npmignore`.
